# SFRFs Toolbox v1.0.0 - First Public Release

This is the first stable release of the **Spectral Fault Receptive Fields
(SFRFs) Toolbox** for MATLAB.
It provides a modular, end-to-end framework for computing biologically inspired spectral receptive-field representations from vibration signals, enabling
condition monitoring, diagnostics, and degradation analysis of rotating
machinery.

---

## Highlights

**Complete implementation of the SFRF pipeline**:

- Bearing parameter modelling
- Fault frequency band computation
- Center–surround receptive-field gain functions
- SFRF computation in time or frequency domain

**Full ensemble-processing architecture with**:

- `EnsembleBroker` and `SFRFsEnsembleBroker`
- FFT and SFRF ensemble processors (parallel-ready)
- Centralized ensemble datastore registry

**Integrated logging**

**Validated parameters for rolling-element bearing faults**

**Built-in support for the** *XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset*

## Installation

You can install the toolbox in one of three ways:

1. **Download the `.mltbx` file** from the Assets section below and double-click it in MATLAB
2. Install from the GitHub repository using `sfrfs_install`
3. (Coming soon) Install via MATLAB Add-On Explorer / File Exchange

Full installation instructions are available in the repository’s README.

## Documentation

The repository contains:

- Livescripts with examples
- Autogenerated **HTML documentation**
- API reference for all toolbox classes and functions
- Diagrams and development notes in the `devel/` folder


---

## Testing

You can verify your installation by running:

```matlab
runtests('Spectral Fault Receptive Fields/tests')
```

All tests should pass.

## Assets for this Release

- **SFRFsToolbox_v1.0.0.mltbx** (recommended for end users)
- Auto-generated source code archives (zip/tar.gz)
